CSCI 344 - Programming Language Concepts
Assignment A0 (0 points)
Due Monday, Aug 24, 2020

NOTE:

The purpose of this assignment is for you to become familiar with the
process of how to submit your homework assignment answers. With few
exceptions, all of your homework assignments will have this format.

You are to answer each of these questions, indicated by lines following
each '##QUESTION:' line, by entering your corresponding answer lines
following each '##ANSWER:' line.  Please leave whitespace around your
answers so they are easy to read. DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT TO THE '##ANSWER:'
LINE.

Your submission must include this entire TEXT file, with your answers
added as described above.  Copy this file into a suitable working
directory and edit this file using a text editor (NOT a word processor)
by adding your answers.

DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE QUESTIONS OR OTHER TEXT CONTAINED IN
THIS FILE except for adding your answers to the questions or replacing
obvious directives such as "<replace this ...>" or "**FIXME**".  Be sure
your answers are on lines that *follow* each '##ANSWER:' line.  Add more
whitespace in your answer lines if you need to do so, but LEAVE THE
ORIGINAL FILE CONTENTS AS-IS.

This file (a0) can be found on the CS lab server here:

   /usr/local/pub/plcc/Assignments/A0/a0

As described in the ##SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS section at the end of this
assignment description, your edited file 'a0' will be packaged into a zip
file 'A0.zip' that you will submit in myCourses.

##QUESTION 1 (0 pts):
    What is your name, email address, and CSCI344 section number?

##ANSWER:

Nikhil Raina, nxr5013@g.rit.edu, CSCI.344.02-03

##QUESTION 2 (0 pts):
    Are you attending any RIT classes this semester in person?

##ANSWER:

    yes

##QUESTION 3 (0 pts):
    In what directory on the CS systems will you find
    the material for this class (notes, assignments, PLCC, etc)?

##ANSWER:

    /usr/local/pub/plcc/

##QUESTION 4 (0 pts):
    What do the letters "PLCC" stand for?

##ANSWER:

    Programming Language compiler Compiler

##QUESTION 5 (0 pts):
    True/False: in this course, you will be learning how to write programs
    in Cobol.

##ANSWER:

    False

##SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
    Create a flat zip file A0.zip (note the capital 'A') containing
    ONLY the following file:

    a0 (this file, with your answers in each ##ANSWER section)

##SUBMISSION NOTES:

    Copy this file (a0) to a suitable directory and make changes to this
    file before submitting it. Do *not* make any changes to the file
    EXCEPT BY ADDING YOUR ANSWERS FOLLOWING EACH OF THE ##ANSWER lines.

    A 'flat' zip file contains only files, no directories (or "folders").
    When I unzip your A0.zip submission, I should see *only* the file
    'a0', and nothing else. In particular, there should not be a directory
    named 'A0'.

    Do *not* submit plain text files with extensions such as 'a0.txt'.
    The Windows operating system often silently adds the '.txt' extension
    to text files, so be sure that these extensions are removed when
    adding them to your zip file. The best way to ensure this is to
    do your work on the CS lab Ubuntu systems and to create your zip
    file there. Assuming that you have populated your a0 file with your
    answers, create your A0.zip subission file as follows:

        zip A0 a0

    Once your have done this, submit your A0.zip file to your A0 dropbox
    in myCourses.

    **The due date and time for this submission is Monday, Aug 24,
    at 11:59pm.**
